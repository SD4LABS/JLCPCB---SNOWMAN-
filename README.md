# JLCPCB---SNOWMAN

I made this Snowman PCB for JLCPCB - PCB Design Challenge. I had just couple of hours to work on it on the last day because of A level Exams. All LEDs on the PCB are connected to digital pins of atmega328p. I used PWM pins for eyes and for 3 LEDs on lower body. I used red and green LEDS. All components are from JLCPCB SMT assembly library. For the outline I first edited the image using photoshop, then imported it in EASYEDA, then slowly using curved line tool I made segments to complete the board outline. Solder mask colour of PCB is white. Estimated Dimensions: 152mm x 195mm. I made it rather large and I want to make a smaller version in the future but for now I like the big snowman.

JLCPCB was the first PCB service I used and I still always use them, really recommend them for their quality while offering cheapest prices. Visit here: https://jlcpcb.com
